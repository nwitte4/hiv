      <p>A recent survey of people living with HIV in the United Kingdom found that more than half would participate in a clinical study to develop a cure for HIV, despite this posing a risk to their health.

There is currently no cure for HIV. But a number of clinical trials around the world are exploring new approaches to curing the disease. There have also been a handful of highly publicised cases where individuals achieved a type of HIV “remission” following medical intervention.!</p>

    <div class="col-1">
      <p>But participating in clinical trials that could take researchers closer to a cure for HIV comes with risks. In some cases, participants with HIV may be required to stop using antiretroviral treatment for a period of time. This may increase their viral load and can potentially lead to drug resistance.</p>

    <div class="col-1">
      <p>Antiretroviral treatment is central to the long-term management of HIV. It helps prevent damage to the body’s immune system, ensuring people with HIV can remain well and live a normal life. It also reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others.

Participation in a HIV cure trial will generally require blood testing and can involve invasive procedures such as tissue biopsies. Participants may also experience side effects from the drugs or treatments being trialled.</p>
